# Jobby
## Penang Part Time Job Portal

Jobby is a job portal website I created together [Ryan Goh](https://github.com/ryangoh), [Jia You](https://github.com/lowjiayou), [Yin Wai](https://github.com/wanyinwai) and [Adric Ang](https://github.com/adric38) for people living in Penang, Malaysia looking for part time jobs.

The live website can be found here at [Jobby Job Portal](http://rails-jobby.herokuapp.com/)

We created Jobby from scratch using Ruby On Rails, deployed and hosted it at Heroku.

For the complete code for Jobby, please visit [master branch](https://github.com/ryangoh/Jobby).

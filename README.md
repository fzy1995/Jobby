# Jobby
### A freelance project marketplace

Jobby is a job portal website I created together [RyanGoh](https://github.com/ryangoh), [JiaYou](https://github.com/lowjiayou), [YinWai](https://github.com/wanyinwai) and [AdricAng](https://github.com/adric38) for people living in Penang, Malaysia looking for part time jobs.

The live website can be found here [Jobby](http://rails-jobby.herokuapp.com/)

We created Jobby from scratch using Ruby On Rails, deployed and hosted it at Heroku.
